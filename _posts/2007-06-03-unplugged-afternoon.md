Jill and I hosted an 'unplugged' afternoon today. A couple of families came over this afternoon and we played several easy to learn and quick to play games. There were nearly 20 at the house and ages ranged from about 6 to 45. We had 4 tables set up around the house that everyone rotated through playing:

It was a great afternoon to play a few games and hang out on the porch afterwards with burgers, dogs and conversation.
