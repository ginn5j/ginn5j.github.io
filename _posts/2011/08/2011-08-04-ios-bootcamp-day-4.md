One day to go and only three chapters that we haven't reviewed. Today's topics included animation, web services, split view controllers (think the iPad email view), multi-touch events, blocks (i.e., closures for those of you in the computer science field) and looking at the instrumentation available in Xcode (i.e., analyzing code for memory leaks, code profiling, etc.).

Clearly everyone is mentally weary after consuming and valiantly trying to digest all of the material presented this week. What to do when I am home? Make it real and apply these concepts by developing some of the ideas I've been kicking around for the last few months.
