We finished the book this morning ... and flew home. Learned about finding/consuming services and push notifications. We also had the media and preferences/settings presentations today.

No, my phone still does not connect or charge yet. I still have Jill's 3GS and, if nothing else, I can move my sim card into that phone until the new iPhone is available later this year.

The next few days to a week will be spent reviewing the class materials and finishing the exercises I couldn't complete in class without an iOS device attached to my development environment. I'll also start noodling on my first project. ðŸ˜€
