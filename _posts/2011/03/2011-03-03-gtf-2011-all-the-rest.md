My musings about GTF 2011 continued ...

## Fillers and Lighter Fare

Some were old and some were new but all were light and fluffy.

[Ghosts](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2290/ghosts) is an old Stratego-like game Luke brings each year and about 10 games are played in 30 minutes or less.

[Hey Waiter!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/67309/hey-waiter) was a recent release from R&R Games with a restaurant theme using cards to eliminate the stack of colored chips (representing food) in front of you before your opponents do. 

We also played through the Easy Play series ([Level X](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/63975/level-x), [Numeri](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/60316/numeri), [Big Points](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34004/big-points) and [Finito!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34166/finito)) in about an hour. Nothing here but quick playing games that do a fine job filling the time between meatier fare.

## Standards

I was glad to play favorites such as [Power Grid](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2651/power-grid), [Pandemic](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic), [Race for the Galaxy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28143/race-for-the-galaxy), [Pillars of the Earth](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24480/the-pillars-of-the-earth) and [Thurn & Taxis](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21790/thurn-and-taxis) again this year.

We used the Japan map for Power Grid. The interesting twists with this map include specific starting locations, cities with 2 spaces or no space of a particular level (e.g, 2 10 spaces or no 15 space) and the ability to start 2 separate networks. I also saw the Central Europe map being played later in the weekend. Pandemic saw multiple plays. It has become the regular co-op game at GTF.

## New Stuff

Other than the deck-building and filler games, the only other new games I played were [Troyes](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/73439/troyes) and the new edition of [DungeonQuest](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/71061/dungeonquest-3rd-edition). Using dice in clever ways has been a recurring theme over the last couple of years. 

Troyes creates an interesting mash-up of using dice for actions and worker placement. 

DungeonQuest is a light, dungeon crawl that is random and purely tactical. It was easily the most played game at the event this year. I played once and saw it being played at least another 6 - 8 times. In all, DungeonQuest was likely played 12+ times over the three and a half days.

## Epic Proportions

I know of at least 2 epic plays at this year's event.

[Runewars](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/59294/runewars) (something I wanted to play but missed) had a play lasting 7 and a half hours. Other plays of this at GTF have been in the 3 -- 4 hour range (still pretty epic). I don't know what caused this one to go so long but I saw some of the guys shambling about like zombies after it finished.

However, the king of epic this year was a 9 hour game of [1830](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/421/1830-railways-robber-barons) (including explanation) between me, Dan and Bob. The best epic games are those that don't feel like it and we all felt this way about 1830. Instead of 9 hours it seemed more like 3. In the end, Dan won running a very profitable B&O (generating $91/share/operating round with 2 engines -- a 6 and a Diesel). His net worth was $12,230. Bob and I lagged by about $2K each.

## Misses

I missed opportunities to play Runewars and [Ascension](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/69789/ascension-chronicle-of-the-godslayer). I don't know if [Sid Meier's Civ](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/77130/sid-meiers-civilization-the-board-game) was played or not (I don't recall seeing it set up in any of the cabins).

Luke brought a variety of maps but we did not play [AoS](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4098/age-of-steam) this year. However, I did see some of the guys playing the Europe map for [Railroad Tycoon/Railways of the World](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38479/railways-of-the-world) instead.

## Until Next Year

And that's it for GTF 2011. The count down clock has been reset and it's little more than 350 days until 20 guys in 5 cabins for 4 days with a few 100 games do it all over again for GTF 2012! ðŸ˜€
