Logan and Caleb are now Red Belts and are 2 tests from becoming Black Belts. Assuming they pass on the 1st attempt each time, they will be Black Belts next April. This was a big milestone for Tristan. He passed his testing to become a 1st Degree Probationary Black Belt. This is the first level of Black Belt and he must wait 4 months before he can test for 1st Degree Decided.

One of the new things Tristan can choose to do is become a student instructor. One reason for achieving his black belt was so that he could become an instructor. He starts on Monday by attending his first instructor meeting/class. Jill and I are very proud of how well each of the boys has progressed in this sport. We hope they continue to stay involved!
