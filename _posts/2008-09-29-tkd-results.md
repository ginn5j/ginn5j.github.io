Caleb placed out of the medals this weekend. He recently passed the 2nd Degree test and is learning a new form. Also, since turning 14, he competes in the adult division. Needless to say, his competition is tough...time and experience will help.

Tristan competed in a group of 11 1st Degree black belts. He finished 3rd in forms (after losing a tie-breaker for 2nd) and 4th in sparring.

Both did a great job at the national level. Tristan will be testing for 2nd Degree in Oct and Caleb will be testing for his instructor collar at the same time. Logan will be wrapping up football in another week and will be back at TKD after that.
