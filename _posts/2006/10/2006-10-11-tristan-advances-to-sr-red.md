Tristan was awarded his senior red belt in Taekwondo tonight. He will be eligible to test for his probationary black belt in December. He's worked hard to get this far. We are proud of his accomplishment and are excited at where he's going. He wants to become an instructor and will be able to begin that once he has passed his first testing after becoming a black belt.

Caleb and Logan will resume their TKD studies as football ends and Logan's cast comes off. They are at senior brown and should become black belts next year.
