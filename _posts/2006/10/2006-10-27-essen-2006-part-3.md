Here's what I brought back...

## Played

Yspahan  
Die Baumeister von Arkadia  
Il Principe  
24/7  
Arche Opti Mix + expansion  
Wayfinder
  
## Not played

### Hermagor 

Another by the designer of Oltre Mare. Purchased after explanation by designer.

### Through the Ages

Czech Board Games. A lot of buzz. Looks to be good.

### Graenaland

Another by CBG. Faintly Settlers like.

### Null & Nichtig

Played back in the States. Unusual trick taking game. I like it!

### Relikt

Retheme of earlier Rudiger Dorn game. Boys and I played this week. They liked it. Plays quickly.

### TtR 1910

Primarily purchased for the larger cards but glad to have another Ticket to Ride variant.

### Havoc -- Card Expansion

Only had the BGG.con expansion. This has all the extras.

### Blue Moon City expansion (spielbox)

Adds 2 additional buildings to the game. There is another expansion coming in the December issue of Spielbox (9.50 euro to the US).

### Thurn & Taxis expansion (spielbox)

Adds a way to perform more than one special action per turn.

### Power Grid

Benelux/Central Europe expansion --- New boards.

## To consider down the road...

### Leonardo da Vinci

Played at Essen and liked. Some are complaining about the basic setup. Will watch the 'geek to see how this develops. Still seems to be a good game.

### Perikles

Possible purchase once it makes its way to the US.

### Pillars of the Earth (Saulen der Erde)

Supposed to be released in the US next year.
