A friend of mine and avid Geocacher, [IndyMagicMan](https://www.geocaching.com/profile/default.aspx?guid=38506752-8242-4728-b40b-749095f99ec2), recently gave me one of [his GeoCoins](https://sites.google.com/site/immgeocoins/) after helping him on one of his Geocaching adventures. This is number 24. Only 100 were made. Pretty neat, eh?
