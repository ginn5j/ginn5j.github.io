[Chris](https://www.chrisbrooks.org/) clued me in that the 2.0 software update was available. After loading it up, I wandered over to the new Apps section of iTunes to see what was there. Lo and behold, there was an ebook reader, one of the native apps I was most interested in seeing on the iPhone.

Ideally, I would be able to sync books from iTunes but we'll see how pulling them from eReader goes.
