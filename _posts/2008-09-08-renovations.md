We're having the floors on the 1st and 2nd levels of the house re-done right now. Everything is NOT business as usual right now. The installers were in today taking out the floor in the kitchen to prep for the engineered hardwood that will go down later this week. It'll be quite nice when it is all finished but it's a mess at the moment!
