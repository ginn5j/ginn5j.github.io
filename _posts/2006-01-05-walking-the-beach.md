In addition to sand castles and swimming, we do a bit of walking along the beach.

The whole family made the trip on the 30th. The tide was out but slowly coming in that morning. We made it around the point without too many of us getting wet. <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://static.flickr.com/40/81796138_b0d65e78ce.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="https://static.flickr.com/40/81796138_b0d65e78ce.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>The kids poked around on the rocks and collected a few shells.

Logan miscalculated his jump and landed about waist deep in water. He wasn't so happy on the walk back.
