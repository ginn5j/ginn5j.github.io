In addition to sand castles and swimming, we do a bit of walking along the beach. We usually head to the south end of the beach a couple of times while we're at the condo. There is a sea wall you have to navigate to get around to the point where it is rockier and the shell hunting is better. The whole family made the trip on the 30th. The tide was out but slowly coming in that morning. We made it around the point without too many of us getting wet. The kids poked around on the rocks and collected a few shells. We took a few pictures of the kids and will use one to send out in our mega-late holiday cards this year. When we came back around the point, the surf was rougher and each of received a bit of a soaking moving from the rocks to the sea wall. Logan miscalculated his jump and landed about waist deep in water. He wasn't so happy on the walk back.
