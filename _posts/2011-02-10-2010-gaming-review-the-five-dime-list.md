Gaming has been a bit slow this last year. I logged nearly 150 plays amongst 50 or so unique titles. This is a significant drop from the previous 3 years of averaging 225 plays a year. My gaming group hasn't been meeting regularly and we haven't played as often at home either, accounting for much of the reduction.

Still, I have managed high frequency plays of a few titles in the past year.

## [Dominion](https://bgg.cc/boardgame/36218/dominion) (and [Dominion: Intrigue](https://bgg.cc/boardgameexpansion/40834/dominion-intrigue))

The progenitor of the current craze of deck-building games still hits the table on a regular basis. Everyone in the family enjoys playing Dominion and since it plays well with 2, 3 or 4 players, it's an easy suggestion. We haven't played with any expansion beyond Intrigue and I don't think it would be really necessary. We do have Seaside and need to add it to the mix. I expect Dominion will continue to see a moderate amount of action in the coming years. _[22 Plays]_

## [Fluxx](https://bgg.cc/boardgame/258/fluxx)

I'm not a big fan of Fluxx but it fills a very specific niche in our family. It's a game that doesn't require much space and is good for passing time while waiting at a restaurant. I expect this will hang around in this list for a couple more years until the boys are on their own. _[12 Plays]_

## [Euchre](https://bgg.cc/boardgame/6901/euchre)

Tristan and Logan have become interested in Euchre of late and we've played more often to give them the experience and coaching on how to be a good Euchre player. Learning to play Euchre is considered a Hoosier tradition after all! _[9 Plays]_

## [Keltis: Das Orakel](https://bgg.cc/boardgame/66085/keltis-das-orakel)

This is one of the first board game implementations I purchased for the iPhone/iPad. It recycles the core mechanics of Lost Cities, as does each entry in the Lost Cities/Keltis family of games. We don't have a physical copy of the game. But, who needs one? It's perfect in 2 player form on the iPad at a restaurant or coffee shop. And, there is nothing to put away when you're done! This and Small World on the iPad are a great way to travel light and still have a F2F table top experience. _[8 Plays]_

## [Thunderstone](https://bgg.cc/boardgame/53953/thunderstone)

If anything could threaten the frequency we play Dominion, it would be Thunderstone. I first played this at BGGcon in November and ordered a copy immediately. We've been playing it regularly since. The fantasy theme is certainly a draw for the teenagers. I predict Thunderstone will continue to see regular play in our household. _[8 Plays]_

## [Agricola](https://bgg.cc/boardgame/31260/agricola)

I have always enjoyed Agricola but I rarely played more than once or twice a year since it was released. During the holiday break, I taught Jill and Tristan how to play and we played several days in a row. They like the game a lot but are also in the frustrating period of the learning curve with this game. Now that I have fans in the house, I should see 2 or 3 player games more frequently. _[6 Plays]_

## Almost But Not Quite...

Several games almost made the list including:

  * [Bang!](https://bgg.cc/boardgame/3955/bang)
  * [Wits & Wagers](https://bgg.cc/boardgame/20100/wits-wagers)
  * [Carson City](https://bgg.cc/boardgame/39938/carson-city)
  * [DVONN](https://bgg.cc/boardgame/2346/dvonn)
  * [Hive](https://bgg.cc/boardgame/2655/hive),
  * [Puerto Rico](https://bgg.cc/boardgame/3076/puerto-rico)
  * [Small World](https://bgg.cc/boardgame/40692/small-world)

Carson City was the only new to me game in this list. I played once at BGGcon and a couple of times during the holidays. Carson City and [Pillars of the Earth](https://bgg.cc/boardgame/24480/the-pillars-of-the-earth) are my current favorite worker placement games. I've since sold my copies of [Caylus](https://bgg.cc/boardgame/18602/caylus) (the original worker placement game) and its card based follow-up, [Caylus Magna Carta](https://bgg.cc/boardgame/27364/caylus-magna-carta). The time required for Caylus was too much for me. Carson City and Pillars scratch the same itch more quickly.
