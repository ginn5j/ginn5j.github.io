Summer LAX play started this weekend with the Mad Cats (Move -- Attack -- Defend / Character -- Attitude -- Teamwork -- Sportsmanship) traveling to Cincinnati to play in Lax-N-Nati. On Saturday, they finished 2-0-1 against the following teams:

  * Llama Lax : Tie (7-7)
  * All Out Lacrosse : Win (4-0)
  * Team Stickhead : Win (11-3)

They split their games on Sunday, failing to advance to the championship game. Still, a great showing for a group of kids that only started playing two weeks ago.

  * Black Jack Elite Blue : Loss (6-7)
  * Smoky Mountain Elite : Win (8-1)

Off to the Midwest Cup in St. Louis next weekend!
