I thought I was done with this but, you know, life happens.

The Game of Thrones quote, "What is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger," is so apropos for this 'blog.

It began on Blogspot back in '05 and in '10, I moved it to a self-hosted Wordpress site where it lived until I killed it in '19 after no new material in more than 2 years. Fortunately, I archived the site. I've resurrected the content and pushed it all into a git repository that is published on GitHub Pages and accessible through my [website](https://ginn5j.com).
