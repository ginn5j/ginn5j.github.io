MIT Technology Review has published a previously unpublished [essay](https://web.archive.org/web/20160126091456/http://www.technologyreview.com/view/531911/isaac-asimov-asks-how-do-people-get-new-ideas/) by Isaac Asimov on the subject of creativity written in 1959.

Of all the writers from the [Golden Age of Science Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Science_Fiction), Asimov was my favorite author. He wrote about wonderfully original ideas AND he wrote well. In the 50's, 60's and 70's, his written output consisted largely of non-fiction material, much of it in the popular science arena. With a deliberately clear and concise writing style, he presented complex scientific subjects in a manner accessible to the lay person.
