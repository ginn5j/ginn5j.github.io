I'm gaming with good friend, [Chris Brooks](https://chrisbrooks.org/), on the Oregon coast this week. During the first half of the week, we are playing epic and war games. Later in the week, a few more folks show up and we move into shorter, euro-style games. It is also great to have gaming friends, KC Humphrey ([Havoc: The Hundred Years War](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/19363/havoc-hundred-years-war)) and Jeff DeBoer ([Funagain Games](https://funagain.com/)), involved since I don't see them more than once every year or so.

## Sunday

Chris, Ken C and I played Supreme Commander. [Supreme Commander](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39066/supreme-commander) is a European Theater strategic war game by GMT. Chris [wrote](https://chrisbrooks.org/blog/2015/02/13/learning-to-be-the-supreme-commander/) about preparing for our play in the weeks leading up to this event. For a grand strategy game, the rules complexity is relatively low. Still, it is a BIG game! We played all day and didn't progress beyond the end of 1940.

After a whiskey, bourbon, rye, scotch tasting, we pulled out a few decks of [A Game of Thrones LCG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39953/game-thrones-card-game) and a multiplayer game ensued.

## Monday

Chris and I started with [Richard III: The War of the Roses](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25277/richard-iii-wars-roses). R3 is a block war game by Columbia Games in the same vein as Hammer of the Scots. The mechanics of R3 are very much like Hammer but Chris and I felt R3 is a more straightforward implementation of the system and like it better. 

In the middle of the day, Doug C, Chris, KC, Jeff and I played [Manifest Destiny](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12283/manifest-destiny). This is a card driven civ type game with a fair bit of player interaction. I enjoyed Manifest Destiny but, overall, like [Clash of Cultures](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/40765/clash-cultures) better and we played that later in the evening!

## Tuesday

KC and I played [Twilight Struggle](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12333/twilight-struggle) in the morning. TS is a favorite of mine and covers the Cold War using the card driven mechanic that originated with We the People. In the afternoon, KC, Jeff, Alex C and I played [Eclipse](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/72125/eclipse), a space themed 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) game that plays so well, I sold my copy of Twilight Imperium a few years ago.

## Wednesday

Jeff and I played [Legend of the 5 Rings](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1887/legend-five-rings) in the morning. L5R is a oriental themed collectible card game. It's one of the only CCGs continuously published since it first appeared about a year after Magic: The Gathering. The rest of the day was spent deck building with the [A Game of Thrones](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39953/game-thrones-card-game) boosters Chris distributed the evening before and playing against each other.

## To Be Continued...

The week is half over and has been great fun to this point. Tomorrow, we'll play a few more epic games before moving on to the euro-style portion of the week.
