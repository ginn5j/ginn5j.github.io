Logan played his first high school Lacrosse game in Lexington last weekend. The JV and Varsity teams were 2-1 against Sayre (JV played the Dixie Heights Varsity team), Lexington Catholic and Tates Creek. Today, he competed against Penn in his first Lacrosse game against another Indiana team.

He is a captain on the JV team and one of the starting mid-fielders. The JV squad played Penn to a 5-5 tie at the end of regulation, ultimately dropping the match 5-6 after three overtimes! The Varsity squad is now 3-1 after a 13-4 win over Penn today.
