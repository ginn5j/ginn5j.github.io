Stephen King's _The Dark Tower_ series has been on my radar for a long while. After finishing Jordan's 14 book epic, _The Wheel of Time_, last year, I may be ready to tackle this beast. But, instead of reading the series straight through, I intend to include many of the related King stories connected with _The Dark Tower_ Saga. Many recommended reading lists exist on the 'net. I picked this list posted in an [article](https://www.onemanasylum.com/home/reading-the-dark-tower-series.html) over at One Man Asylum:

  * The Eyes of the Dragon
  * It
  * Everything’s Eventual: The Little Sisters of Eloria
  * The Dark Tower Book I: The Gunslinger
  * The Dark Tower Book II: The Drawing of the Three
  * The Dark Tower Book III: The Wastelands
  * Rose Madder
  * The Talisman
  * Night Shift: Night Surf
  * The Stand
  * The Dark Tower Book IV: Wizard & Glass
  * Night Shift: Jerusalem’s Lot
  * ‘Salem’s Lot
  * Night Shift: One for the Road
  * The Dark Tower Book VIII: The Wind Through the Keyhole
  * Hearts in Atlantis
  * The Dark Tower Book V: Wolves of the Calla
  * The Dark Tower Book VI: Song of Susannah
  * Black House
  * Insomnia
  * Skeleton Crew: The Mist
  * Everything’s Eventual: Everything’s Eventual
  * The Dark Tower Book VII: The Dark Tower

I've read many of the related novels (_It_, _The Talisman_, _The Stand_, _'Salem's Lot_) but not for 20 years or more so I plan to revisit them. If you have a better list, drop me a line!
