I'm sitting at TGI Fridays in the terminal after another fun BGG convention. 

To close out the weekend, we played the new, deluxe edition of [Power Grid](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2651/power-grid). We didn't notice any changes to the rules. This edition has a double sided map with North America on one side and Europe on the reverse. The artwork is different and the boards now have an area to hold the power plant market. On the other hand, some of the visual helpers are no longer printed on the board such as the number of cities that trigger Step 2 and the end game based on the number of players in the game. Regardless of the printing, this is one of my all-time favorite games, certainly in my top 5.

So long Dallas, [Aldie](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/Aldie) and [BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/bggcon) ... until we meet again in 2015!
