We had our Christmas get together at my folks today. Kimberly and her kids were there and we all exchanged gifts. The boys received Nerf dart tag guns from their grandparents that were a blast to play, including me! Everyone is good. Mom and Dad are refinishing the basement. The walls are done. They have to put down the new flooring and finish the ceiling. It'll be nice once they are done.
