Just finished the _Ilium/Olympos_ cycle by Dan Simmons. Like the _Hyperion/Endymion_ cycle, there are a lot of interesting ideas tossed about. Unlike the other though, this series is 2 books rather than 4. In these novels, Simmons deals with genetic manipulation (on a grand scale), travel between universes and quantum manipulation. This is very much in the space opera genre/realm and uses classical literature (namely Shakespeare's _The Tempest_ and Homer's _Iliad_) to drive the story.

The first book, _Ilium_, is excellent. The second, _Olympos_, is good but the story fizzles toward the end. _Olympos_ builds and builds but never delivers a strong one-two punch toward the end. The last 50 or so pages talks about what everyone is doing after all the problems have been eliminated. This ending was a let down as it was unnecessary.

Read the first, it is very good. Read the second only if you want to get to a resolution of sorts. If you are a Dan Simmons fan, these books will satisfy.
