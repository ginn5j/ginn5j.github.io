Jill flew into Boston at the end of the week and we stayed through the weekend to do a bit of sightseeing. We did sightseeing activities during the day and and gaming ([Lost Cities](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/50), [Carolus Magnus](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/481), [San Juan](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/8217) and [Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/106)) in the evening at the Starbucks in the hotel. Whenever we played Carolus Magnus, we had someone stop by and ask about the game. They usually walked away with the name of some games to try and the address for [BoardGameGeek](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/). ðŸ™‚

On Friday afternoon, we walked over to the [Museum of Fine Arts](https://www.mfa.org/) and spent a couple of hours wandering the galleries. We spent most of the time in the European galleries (Jill likes Impressionism, in general, and Monet, in particular).

We spent much of Saturday walking the Freedom Trail. The National Park Service gives a nice discussion of the history of [Faneuil Hall](https://www.nps.gov/bost/bost_lographics/faneuil.htm). We ended at the USS Constitution ("Old Ironsides"). We discovered that the local gaming store, The Compleat Strategist, was only a couple of blocks from the hotel and visited in the afternoon. They cram a lot of product in a very small space.

On Sunday we went to Cambridge and toured the [Henry Wadsworth Longfellow house](https://www.nps.gov/long/). This is also run by the National Park Service and they provide a very good walking tour. Washington used this house to organize the Continental Army and direct the early stages of the Revolutionary War. We also walked around the campus of Harvard before heading back to Boston and having lunch at the Bull & Finch (the inspiration for Cheers).
