We spent the last few days at Tallulah Gorge State Park in Georgia. The campsites are close together but that's not a real problem with our camper van. The hikes along the north and south rim of the gorge are pretty easy with several overlooks on each trail. The visitor and nature center go into detail about the history of the gorge and the effort at conservation that eventually led to the state park. Oh, and the falls are pretty spectacular!
