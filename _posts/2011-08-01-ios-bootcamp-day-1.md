While exploring more of the trails around the lodge this morning, I snapped a few pics. Class ran from 9 to 6 today. We chewed through six of the 29 chapters in the text. The morning was primarily a quick review of Objective C. This afternoon was significantly meatier with a look at location services, the map kit and subclassing views. The complexity will continue to increase all week. Who's head will explode first?! ðŸ˜‰

The demographics are likely what you would expect for an application development class at least from a gender perspective. Of the 20 students, only two are female. Two of the students are primarily Spanish speaking. The instructor is fluent in Spanish (native), French (2nd language) and English (3rd). Age ranges from a couple of college students to middle age geezers like me and older.
