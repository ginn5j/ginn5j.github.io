The 2 month cycle for TKD testing came around today. All 3 boys were ready and tested today. Caleb was testing for Blue while Logan and Tristan were testing for Sr. Blue. All 3 completed their form in only 1 attempt and looked like their sparring went well. I'm quite certain they will be awarded their next belt at the awards ceremony based on their performance today. They are about a year away from becoming Black belts at this point with Brown, Sr Brown, Red and Sr Red still ahead of them before they can test for Black. Tristan and Logan also went to a board breaking clinic last week. When they test for Brown, they will have demonstrate 1 foot and 1 hand board breaking technique. Logan broke all 10 boards (1 at a time ðŸ™‚ and Tristan broke 6.
