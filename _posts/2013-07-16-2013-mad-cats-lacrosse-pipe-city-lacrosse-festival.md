The Mad Cats traveled to Chicago over the weekend (7/13 -- 7/14) to play in the Pipe City Lacrosse Festival and wrap up the Summer of LAX! This team normally plays U15 (15 & under) but registered late and chose to play in the U17 Gold division (the U15 divisions were full). On Saturday, they finished 2-1-0 against the following teams:

  * Team Total Varsity : Win (7-4)
  * Team One U16 Thunderbird Red and Blue : Loss (4-13)
  * Orange Lacrosse : Win (10-5)

On Sunday they dropped both games (Golden Eagle Elite in pool play and Team One in bracket play):

  * Golden Eagle Elite : Loss (2-10)
  * Team On U16 Thunderbird Red and Blue : Loss (semifinal game)

The 'Cats wrapped the summer season with another top 4 finish (while playing up at U17!) and will play in the Tournament of Champions at the end of the year.
