The Mystery Rummy series is one of our favorite 2-player games. I pulled out Jekyll & Hyde this evening to play during dinner (I arrived late after unsuccessfully trying to finish off some things at work so I wouldn't need to go in on Wednesday!) and was promptly hung out to dry. Jill accomplished shut-outs in the 1st and 3rd hands --- schooling me in a big way --- 100+ to 33. Ouch!
