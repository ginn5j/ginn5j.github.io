Back in April, we visited [Chris Brooks](https://www.chrisbrooks.org/)' family and [explored Portland and the Oregon coast](https://ginn5j.blogspot.com/2006/04/spring-break-in-portland-oregon.html). Last week, we drove over to the other coast and spent the week on the Outer Banks in North Carolina with our friends, Bob & Julie and their kids.

Most of the week was spent relaxing, playing games and catching up on a bit of reading. We did take in a few of the sights in the area. At the northern end, near Corolla, Mustangs (wild horses of Spanish descent) roam free. We spent a couple of hours in 4&#215;4's traveling the beach and unpaved trails learning about the origin and history of the area while searching for groups of the beasts. We did see quite a few. Logan counted 40+. Very impressive sight, especially the adult/child pair at the water's edge when we were returning from the trip.

We also spent a day on Roanoke, the location of the first English colony in America. There is a living museum (not unlike Conner Prairie in Indiana) called the Festival Park. Sights included a seaworthy replica of the Elizabeth, one of the ships that delivered the first load of colonists from England, and a working blacksmith.

On the way to and from Roanoke, we drove through Kill Devil Hills. The national Wright Memorial is located there and is visible from a distance. We did not stop to visit the park but the memorial is impressive sitting atop a very high dune at the site.

Games we played during the week: Havoc, Time's Up, Wits and Wagers, Commands & Colors: Ancients, Hammer of the Scots, Blink (the kids ran a Blink tournament one evening), Bang!, Fairy Tale, Blue Moon, Lost Cities, Cartagena and Louis XIV

I think it's safe to say everyone had a good time. The kids spent a lot of time outdoors --- at the beach, pool or riding scooters around the neighborhood. The adults plowed through more than 10 books during the week.
