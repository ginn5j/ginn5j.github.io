Heartbreaker this morning. Logan's game was early this morning and the dew was heavy. This meant the field was damp and the ball was often wet. Mistakes occur more frequently under these conditions and that was the case for both teams today. The Pats scored on their first possession early in the 1st half. The only other time the ball saw the end zone was a TD run by the Packers that was called back for holding.

Logan continued to play at the corner on defense and also moved into the offensive line today. He hasn't practiced much on that side of the ball and was frustrated that he wasn't blocking well. However, on the defensive side, he had a great game. He was involved in several tackles including 2 solo take downs behind the line of scrimmage.
