The annual [gaming retreat](https://www.gtfgamers.org/) with my friends starts today. That means I'll be off-line until at least Sunday. It's not a large gathering (25 this year) but it's big enough that you can always start a game with someone. The [game library](https://gtfgamers.org/index.php?title=GTF_2006_Games_Planned) is composed of selections and requests from our individual collections.

Our tag line "One Roll To Rule Them All" was coined by Brian with sincerest apologies to Mr. Tolkien and his hobbits.
