Arrived in DFW and hooked up with Chris Brooks. Spent the afternoon helping with the setup --- bagging goodie bags, etc. Played one of the new Martin Wallace designs later in the day called After the Flood. It's a 3 player only war/economic game. Met up with Jeff DeBoer at dinner and played a couple of games of a tile laying game called Cities and wrapped it up for the evening with Race for the Galaxy.
