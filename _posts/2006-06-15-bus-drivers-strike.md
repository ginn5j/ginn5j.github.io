Late Tuesday, the unionized bus drivers (Teamsters, I believe) decided to strike. Lovely that they chose TechEd to inconvenience, eh? Although, if I were union and wanted to make a point, I'd use a large convention like this to get attention. That doesn't change the fact that it's rather irritating to us attendees when many of us are located at hotels that take 30 minutes or more to travel to and from the convention center by bus. I walked back last night and it wasn't any faster. The convention ends tomorrow and the folks driving the buses have done an admirable job putting up with the nasty comments and gestures from the striking workers in front of the convention center and the hotels.
