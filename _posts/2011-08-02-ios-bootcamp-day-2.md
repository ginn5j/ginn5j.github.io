Early morning runs are not easy here for someone used to the flat terrain of Indiana. They have hills and they are long, steep affairs. I had lots of new knowledge crammed into my head today -- views, controllers, the accelerometer, notifications, device rotation, tables and navigation. I'm taking it all in but it will take some time to settle and become useful.

Lion, the newest version of OS X, was released a couple of weeks ago and I made a deliberate decision to not upgrade my OS or Xcode (the developer tools) prior to taking this class and I'm glad I did. Most of the technical issues in the class are occurring on machines with Lion installed or those using the Xcode/iOS 5 beta.

Oh, and the college students? They aren't in college just yet. They just graduated high school and will be freshman in the fall.
