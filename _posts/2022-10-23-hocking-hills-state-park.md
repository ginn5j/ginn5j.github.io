The last stop on our trip this month was Hocking Hills State Park in Ohio, southeast of Columbus. It's a great park with a lot of interesting trails and things to see. It's a little too popular and crowded on the weekend for my tastes. We didn't see all there is to see at this park and I think we'll be back for another stay but during the week instead of over a weekend.
