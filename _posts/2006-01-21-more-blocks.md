The folks that are finishing this job in 2 hours work fast. I finished 90 blocks tonight in roughly that time frame. The pace is picking up but I'd say it'll be at least another 3-4 hours to finish the job. After the last break, I finished the Light Bow, Light Sling, Chariots, Elephants and Leaders. Like Battle Cry, the dice are blank and will need the stickers applied. However, unlike

Battle Cry dice, these are very light plastic. I'll be stopping by the FLGS (tomorrow?) to see if I can pickup heavier, blank dice closer to those in Battle Cry.
