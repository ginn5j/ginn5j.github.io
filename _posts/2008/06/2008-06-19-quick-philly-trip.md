Friend and colleague, Jason Brown, and I travelled to Philly this week on business and snapped a few pics on the iPhone along the way...

Business casual + backpack = modern dork ðŸ™‚ Don't you agree?!?

McGillan's is the oldest pub in Philly and an awesome place to share a few pitchers with friends. Yards IPA comes highly recommended.
