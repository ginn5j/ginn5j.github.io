Caleb, Tristan and I are in Gatlinburg until Sunday morning for one of the 2 national tournaments run by their TKD association. It's raining now but we spent a few hours this morning exploring the edge of the Great Smokey Mountains Nat'l Park via the Roaring Fork motor trail and short hikes at stops along the way. Gorgeous scenery.

This afternoon is testing for 3rd Degree and above. Tomorrow is the competition.
