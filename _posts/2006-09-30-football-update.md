Caleb's team remains tied for 1st and undefeated with 1 week left to play. At this point, his team would be the #2 seed in the playoffs. They've allowed 20 points and the other undefeated team has only allowed 16. Assuming positions do not change next week, Caleb's team will play the #3 seed. The #3 team is coached by the same gentlemen that Caleb's team lost to in the championship game last year.

The last conference game is Saturday, Oct 7. The top 4 teams play for the championship. The playoffs are Thursday, Oct 12, with the championship and consolation games on Saturday, the 14th.
