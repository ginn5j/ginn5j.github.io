I typically run at lunch on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Today's run was a soggy excursion with light rain and moderate wind from the north. Fortunately, that meant a tailwind on the return leg of the journey.

Today's [route](https://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2883594) and the set list: 

  1. Spin Doctors -- Jimmy Olsen's Blues
  2. The Proclaimers -- I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)
  3. Sheryl Crow -- Steve McQueen
  4. Mark Knopfler -- Boom, Like That
  5. Marc Cohn -- Walking in Memphis
  6. Scissor Sisters -- Comfortably Numb
  7. Smash Mouth -- Walkin' on the Sun
  8. Bill Withers -- Ain't No Sunshine
  9. Thomas Dolby -- She Blinded Me with Science
 10. Nirvana -- Lithium
 11. Blues Traveler -- All in the Groove
 12. Warren Zevon -- Werewolves of London
 13. Marc Broussard -- Home
 14. Soft Cell -- Tainted Love
 15. Crash Test Dummies -- Winter Song

5.5 miles at a 9min/mile pace. ðŸ™‚
