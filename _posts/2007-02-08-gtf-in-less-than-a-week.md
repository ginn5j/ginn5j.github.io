The annual gaming weekend I co-host with 5 other friends kicks off next Wednesday (Feb 14). This will be our 8<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">th</span> consecutive year for this party. It'll run until Sunday, the 18<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">th</span>. We cut back on the number of attendees this year plus a few can't make it so we're at 19 this time around.

This event is primarily three and a half days of open gaming. We have a few organized events including opening night Werewolf, a small Magic booster draft tournament and simultaneous play of 4 Kramer action point games (<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Tikal</span>, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Mexica</span>, Java and Torres).

We'll play a smattering of games that were released at this past Essen including Die <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">Baumeister</span> <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">von</span> <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">Arkadia</span>, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">Hermagor</span>, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">Yspahan</span> and Through the Ages. Some relatively recent releases will also hit the table including <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">BattleLore</span>, Blue Moon City and The Great Space Race. We also tend to pull out the classics like El <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">Grande</span>, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11">Roborally</span>, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12">Elfenland</span> and Settlers (of <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_13">Catan</span>).

You can see more about what we're doing [this year](https://gtfgamers.org/index.php?title=GTF_2007) at the [web site](https://gtfgamers.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) we maintain for our group.

I maintained our site for several years using static HTML pages. A couple of years ago, I installed a wiki engine and moved the entire site over. Everyone in our group can make edits and help maintain the site and that has lead to more content being developed and a richer record of what we've done as a gaming group over the last couple of years.

The park we hold the event at has recently enabled wireless access for guests so I may even do a little on site reporting this year rather than the after the fact reports I've done in the past.
