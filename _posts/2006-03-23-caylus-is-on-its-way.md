Just received notification that my copy of [Caylus](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/18602) is on its way...Woohoo! Or, is that Jill's copy?!? I pre-ordered this last November but not soon enough to catch a copy in the first printing. That was fortunate in a way since they decided to replace the money tokens for the 2nd printing. And that was the one thing about the bits that left me wanting about the game when I played it at BGG.con. It's a very good game and I can't wait to play again.
