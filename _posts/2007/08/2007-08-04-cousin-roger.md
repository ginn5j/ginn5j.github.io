No, I don't have a cousin named Roger but I do have a co-worker friend that fronts a band named Cousin Roger. Jill and I went to listen to him at the Champps located at Keystone @ the Crossing. It's a cover band playing rockers from the last 40 years. I don't know what they did with cousin Roger but the band is a lot of fun. If you enjoy local bands at small venues, get out and see Cousin Roger.
