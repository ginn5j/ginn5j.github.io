Logan received his black belt this evening! Now, all the boys are black belts (Tristan in December, Caleb in April). Logan did not break one of his boards in April and that was the only thing that prevented him from achieving it then.

Tristan also moved up during this testing cycle to 1st degree decided. 1st degree has three ranks -- probationary, decided and senior. All three will be attending black belt camp in Georgia later this month.
