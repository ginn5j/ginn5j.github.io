I traveled to Atlanta today and arrived at the [Lodges at Historic Banning Mills](https://www.historicbanningmills.com/) where I'll spend this week learning the ins and outs of application development on the iOS platform. I'm quite excited about the next several days as this is a stepping stone to assist with my transition away from my current job and employer and into the world of mobile application development over the next few months.

The course is hosted by the [Big Nerd Ranch](https://www.bignerdranch.com/) and has a reputation for being an intense 5 days of material. The book used for the course is a thick tome and our instructor said we'll cover most of the topics in it!

I explored a lot of the trails around the facility today and plan to hike and run more when class is not in session. Class runs from 9 to 6 each day. I'll collect my thoughts and perspectives as the class progresses and put them up here as time allows.
