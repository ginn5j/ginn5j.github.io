For Tristan's birthday, he and Jill went over to the Indy Zoo on Sunday to 'swim' with the dolphins. OK...they didn't get to swim with the dolphins, but they did learn a lot about them, be in the water with them and interacted with the dolphins using many of the techniques employed by the trainers. Since Tristan came home beaming, I have the impression that he had a great time.
