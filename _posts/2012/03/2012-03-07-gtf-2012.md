My annual guys weekend filled with gaming occurred a couple of weekends ago. This was year number thirteen. We continue to enjoy a high turnout. Eighteen of the 20+ guys invited were able to make it. A couple had work conflicts and one was off teaching in SE Asia (although the pics I've seen leave me with the impression of an extended vacation ðŸ˜‰). We had another great weather year --- 50s again with a drop on Sunday and rain turning to snow as we left the park. Here is the crew after the cookout on Friday...

GTF is a mix of old and new (to me) gaming. [BGG.con]({% post_url 2011-11-21-bgg-con-2011 %}) leans more heavily toward playing new games than GTF (70/30 vs. 50/50). Highlights from this year's event were Strasbourg, Dominant Species and Airlines Europe. And now for the day to day...

## Wednesday

Travel day. Cabins are released to us around 4pm. Games played are shorter. Nothing epic ... who'd want to miss the opening ceremony?!?

  * Strasbourg
  * Pictomania
  * Flash Duel (x2)
  * Power Grid: First Sparks
  * Prototype

## Thursday

  * Dominant Species
  * Wiz-War
  * Dice Town
  * Innovation

## Friday

Group cookout usually happens on Friday (sometimes on Saturday). Troy's parents have a farm and continue to provide the hamburger for our grilling pleasure. We add chips, buns, ketchup, mustard, pickles, etc! Troy has a portable gas grill he's used to grill the burgers but this year the gas supply line had weakened enough to provide us with an awesome explosion during the first batch of burgers. Out came the charcoal to finish burger grilling duties.

  * Letters from Whitechapel
  * 7 Wonders (x2)
  * Agricola
  * Airlines Europe

## Saturday

  * Pillars of the Earth
  * Havoc (x2)
  * Railroad Tycoon

While the overall number of plays was down over previous years, it was a great weekend of socializing, gaming and enjoying the nice weather.
