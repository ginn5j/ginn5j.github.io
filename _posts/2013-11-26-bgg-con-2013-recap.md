I'm just back from my annual trek to Dallas for a few days of gaming with my great friend, [Chris Brooks](https://chrisbrooks.org). This post will be light on photos since I was remiss in taking a bunch of snaps this year. For a photo tour, check out Chris' post of [day 1](https://chrisbrooks.org/blog/2013/11/21/bggcon-2013-day-1/), [day 2](https://chrisbrooks.org/blog/2013/11/22/bggcon-2013-day-2/), [day 3](https://chrisbrooks.org/blog/2013/11/24/bggcon-2013-day-3/), [day 4](https://chrisbrooks.org/blog/2013/11/24/bggcon-2013-day-4/), and [day 5](https://chrisbrooks.org/blog/2013/11/25/bggcon-2013-day-5/).

## Day 1 (Thursday)

The first day was a bit of a clunker. My flight was delayed 4 hours due to a mechanical issue. I arrived around 11pm and met Chris and Mark Hamzy in the hotel bar for a scotch and chit chat. Undaunted, we grabbed a copy of [Eight Minute Empire](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131366/eight-minute-empire) and played the world's fastest civ game before calling it a night.

## Day 2 (Friday)

Chris taught [Core Worlds](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98351/core-worlds), a game he learned the day before and we had on our list to play from the previous year. I enjoyed this considerably. Better than [Eminent Domain](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68425/eminent-domain) and different enough from other deck builders to consider a purchase.

While Chris was off on a work call, I picked out [Trains](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/121408/trains) as our next game and set about learning the rules. This is another deck builder with considerable similarity to [Dominion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion). Unlike Dominion and most other deck builders, Trains moves beyond the card game into a full fledged board game. I enjoyed Trains tremendously and could see it replacing some of my deck builders (Dominion and [Thunderstone](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/53953/thunderstone) ... I'm looking at you!). We ran into the developer, Steve Ellis, later in the weekend and found out a new base game, Trains 2, is in the works for next year. I may wait until the new version is out before picking up a copy.

After a quick lunch, Chris suggested [Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133038/pathfinder-adventure-card-game-rise-of-the-runelor). I'll call this a cooperative dungeon crawl card game. We played the 3 scenarios from the intro module. It scratches the RPG/dungeon crawl itch with relatively easy set up and quick play. Fun!

After dinner, Jeff DeBoer taught another civ game, [Clash of Cultures](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/40765/clash-of-cultures). Heavy, as most civ games are, I felt like this could be played in 2 -- 3 hours. Enjoyed the variable board set up and the tech tree.

## Day 3 (Saturday)

First up was the coal mine themed game, [Kohle & Kolonie](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/141090/kohle-kolonie), in the hot games area. Played over 5 rounds, it turns out to be a bidding/auction game where auctions are used to simulate mine mergers in rounds 3 -- 5.

Sticking around in the hot games area, we hooked up with Mark Hamzy and MIke Chapel to play [Nations](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/126042/nations). This is yet another civ game although more in the style of [Through the Ages](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25613/through-the-ages-a-story-of-civilization). I enjoyed Nations but liked Clash of Cultures better.

Chris, Mark and I played [Pillars of the Earth](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24480/the-pillars-of-the-earth) with the expansion in the afternoon. Although this doesn't hit the table a lot, I still enjoy this take on the worker placement mechanic that came out about a year after the original worker placement game, [Caylus](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18602/caylus), arrived on the scene.

Mark, Chris and I wrapped up the evening with a play of [Rialto](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/119591/rialto). Joining us was Chris' friend from Israel, Nadine. Rialto is a quick playing Venice themed, area control game. I enjoyed it and would play again but don't feel the need to own a copy.

## Day 4 (Sunday)

With a winter storm approaching, we settled in to a play of [1846](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17405/1846) with Mark Hamzy and Mike Chapel. Chris, with previous experience, provided an explanation and we nearly completed the game in about 4 hours with everyone heading out from Dallas (by auto or plane) around noon.

## The End...

Favorites of the weekend were Clash of Cultures (love the civ with tech tree in less than 3 hours) and Trains (deck building wrapped in a board game). Core Worlds, Pathfinder and Eight Minute Empire were also very good.
