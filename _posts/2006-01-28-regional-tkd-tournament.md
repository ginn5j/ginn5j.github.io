Fishers TKD hosted the regional interschool tournament today. All three boys were signed up to compete but Tristan came down with a fever and sore throat on Thursday. He hasn't tested positive for Strep but didn't feel up to competing today. He and I hung out at home while Caleb and Logan participated in the tournament. In his group, Caleb placed 3rd in forms. Logan captured a 3rd in both forms and sparring. They will be testing for their next belt in about 2 weeks. Caleb will be testing for Blue. Tristan and Logan will be testing for Sr. Blue. Unfortunately, the memory card was in the card reader at the computer so we didn't snap any pictures of the boys in action.
