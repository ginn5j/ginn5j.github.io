Another tough loss for Logan and the team. This time they were tied at the end of regulation and lost in double OT. Logan was in on many tackles again, including multiple solo tackles. The coach moved him around a lot on the line. I think he played nearly every position on the defensive line today. He stayed at a spot until the offense started double teaming him at that position and he could no longer get through.
