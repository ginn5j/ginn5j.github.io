Caleb's team (the Panthers) took over 1st place this weekend. They won their last game -- 28 to 12. The other undefeated team (the Dolphins) also won but allowed 16 points to be scored. Both teams tied on the season for points allowed at 32 which meant they had to go to the 3rd tiebreaker to decide who plays in the 1 seed. The Panthers will do that on Thursday against the Packers.
