The team can't seem to turn the corner this season. Lots of mistakes, particularly the false starts on 1st down handicapping them another 5 yards, contributed to today's loss. Logan spent most of the game at nose guard with occasional downs at linebacker and corner. He typically had two lineman blocking, preventing access to the backfield and had fewer tackles this game. He did recover a fumble that would've been a 1st down had the Colts retained possession. On special teams, he caught a kick-off. He went down on a knee in the process, so no return.

In general, a good effort by the team...just not enough for a win. They are 1-3 with 3 games left. Playoff possibilities are starting to fade.
