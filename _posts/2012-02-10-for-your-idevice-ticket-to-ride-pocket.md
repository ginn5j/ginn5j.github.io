If you don't have Ticket to Ride Pocket, Days of Wonder has made it freely available in the iTunes App Store. If you own the board game or enjoy games in general, you owe it to yourself to try this mini-sized version at no cost. No word on how long this will last ... pick it up today!

I was pleasantly surprised at how well the game plays on the iPhone/iPod Touch given the limited screen real estate. The human factors are some of the best I've seen for a board game conversion to the iPhone. The development team at Days of Wonder did an amazing job!

I do find it odd that Days of Wonder has made one of their games available for free. As far I know, this is the first time it's happened. I suspect it's a tactic to drive sales of Pocket's bigger brother, Ticket to Ride (for the iPad), and in-app purchases of expansions available only on the iPad version.

Still, it's hard to beat free. Enjoy!
