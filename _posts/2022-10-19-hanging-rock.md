After leaving RTP, we treked over to Hanging Rock State Park, north of Winston-Salem.

Moore's Wall Loop Trail cuts across the campground and I hiked that in the morning to see the view from the observation tower (on the site of the old fire tower) at Moore's Knob (at an elevation of 2500').

West. The mountain in the distance with the funny looking top is Pilot Mountain.
