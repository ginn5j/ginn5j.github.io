What have I been working on the last couple of nights? Artwork to use on the shirts for my group's annual micro-convention (ooh, I like that). It's our version of a men's retreat. Four days of gaming at a state park in southern Kentucky. We're mostly about the gaming but we also do a little hiking while we're there. Here are smaller samples of the proposed artwork. I still need the final approval from the group but I think they're ready. The image with the event, dates and location will be a small logo graphic on the front of the shirt over the left breast. The image with the "One Roll" slogan will be a large image on the back of the shirt. You can also see [shirt designs](https://gtfgamers.org/index.php?title=GTF_Event) from previous years.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></p>

  UPDATE:</span> Modified logo graphic to remove glasses and dates.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://static.flickr.com/21/92195140_94c247c16c_o.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;" src="https://static.flickr.com/21/92195140_94c247c16c_o.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://static.flickr.com/28/91612585_4deb6b21cb_m.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 240px;" src="https://static.flickr.com/28/91612585_4deb6b21cb_m.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>
