What have I been working on the last couple of nights? Artwork to use on the shirts for my group's annual micro-convention (ooh, I like that). It's our version of a men's retreat. Four days of gaming at a state park in southern Kentucky. We're mostly about the gaming but we also do a little hiking while we're there. Here are smaller samples of the proposed artwork. I still need the final approval from the group but I think they're ready. The image with the event, dates and location will be a small logo graphic on the front of the shirt over the left breast. The image with the "One Roll" slogan will be a large image on the back of the shirt.
