We dodged the winter storm picking up our Travato in Florida. Now we're back in Indy and want to do a few short trips to acclimate Darwin (our nearly 15 year old dog) to living in the RV. Since it will be warm (i.e., 50+) for the next few days, we load up the Travato and head toward Bloomington and Lake Monroe so I can pick up the military national parks pass before heading over to the Hoosier National Forest for some dispersed camping and a bit of hiking.

The ice on the forest roads and trails was too much to safely camp and hike so we left and regrouped in Bloomington. Brown County State Park has a couple of year round campgrounds so we headed over there to overnight and had a successful night with Darwin. Got up the next morning and caught a wintry sunrise before heading out of the park and back to Indy.
