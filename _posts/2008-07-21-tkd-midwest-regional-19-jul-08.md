We were off to Columbus, OH this weekend for a regional tournament. Caleb was on the sidelines this weekend, recovering from multiple, non-TKD injuries (he can go into the details :). He spent the tournament recording, timing and assisting judges. Logan finished in typical style with a 2nd in sparring. Tristan, on the other hand, tied for 4th in his forms competition, losing the tie-breaker but came on strong in the sparring competition, finishing 1st in his group.

The Canon A95 I was using to capture the action shots just couldn't keep up so enjoy what I could salvage.

The next national tournament will be held in Gatlinburg this September.
