Back home after 3 packed days of gaming in Texas. Bright spots for me were:

  * Brass
  * Thebes
  * Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage
  * Agricola
  * Mission: Red Planet

Will provide additional details in the coming days. Check out Chris Brooks' [blog](https://www.chrisbrooks.org/) for a daily summary and some great pictures. A few stats from the weekend:

  * 17 games played (including a 6.5 hour marathon/learning session of Hannibal) -- 16 were games I'd never played before.
  * Gamed with 23 people. Of those, I already knew or have previously gamed with 8 prior to this year's BGG.con.
  * Assisted with the setup on Wednesday which included 3 hours of helping assemble the mega-Heroscape map designed by Rodney Loyd ([hotrodqt](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/hotrodqt)).

Many thanks to the organizers (Aldie, Derk, Randy, Vickie, et al) for another awesome convention. Chris and I also appreciate that Randy, Tim and Carrie hauled us around for dinner on Thursday and Saturday. It was great to get away from the hotel for a couple of hours and have an alternative to the Denny's across the street!
