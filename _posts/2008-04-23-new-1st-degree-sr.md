Tristan achieved his 1st Degree Sr rating over the weekend. The award ceremony was this evening. It took a couple of times for him to pass. He and Caleb are at 1st Deg Sr and Logan is at 1st Deg Decided. Next up is 2nd Degree. Caleb and Logan will be testing for their Jr Instructor ratings in June. Tristan achieved his instructor rating last fall (...that's the red collar on his jacket).
