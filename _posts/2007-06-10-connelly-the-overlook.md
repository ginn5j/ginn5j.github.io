Just finished reading the latest book featuring my favorite fictional detective -- Harry Bosch. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Overlook</span> by Michael Connelly is a quick read, clocking in at 225 pages and the novelization of a 16 part serial Connelly wrote for the New York Magazine. All of Connelly's Bosch books (13 and counting) are good -- taut, gritty and filled with lots of twists and turns. This one is not the best of the series but it is very compelling and readable in a day.

If you like mystery/thriller fiction with an interesting main character and haven't read Connelly, start with <span style="font-style: italic;">The Black Echo</span> and work your way through all the of the Bosch novels. You won't be disappointed.
