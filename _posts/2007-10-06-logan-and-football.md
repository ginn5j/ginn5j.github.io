Logan's been playing 3rd grade tackle for the last 2 months. Their team struggled during the first half of the season. He's played a number of positions and has settled into regularly playing safety and special teams. Today, they defeated one of the 2 undefeated teams in the league, 15 to 14, and finished with a 4-3 record. This was a must win situation for the team, placing them 6th in the league and sewing up the last playoff spot. They play the #3 seed Tuesday evening and, if successful, play the team they defeated today again next Saturday.
